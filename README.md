# ⚽ Producing Soccer Insights for a Sports Media Agency

This SQL project analyzes match data from the UEFA Championship (2020–2022) to uncover team performance patterns and tactical insights. The goal is to generate actionable insights for a sports media agency using Snowflake SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Identify team performance trends based on possession, duels, and shots.
- Evaluate predictive model accuracy based on actual match outcomes.
- Develop reusable SQL views to optimize analytical workflows.
- Visualize data to support data storytelling for media/reporting use cases.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- **SQL** (Snowflake dialect)
- **Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse**
- (Optional) Python + Jupyter Notebooks for visualization

---

## 📊 Datasets

- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020`
- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021`
- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022`

Each table contains match-level statistics, team names, scores, possession metrics, and prediction probabilities for each UEFA match played.

## Core Insights

### 1. Teams With Most Games of Majority Possession (per Season)
- Identified which team dominated possession most frequently from 2020–2022.
- Used `CASE`, `RANK()`, and multi-table `UNION ALL` to compare team dominance across years.

```sql
WITH all_matches AS (
  SELECT '2020' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '2021' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '2022' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022
),
...
SELECT SEASON, TEAM_NAME, GAME_COUNT
FROM ranked
WHERE team_rank = 1;
```

### 2. Duel Winners Who Still Lost the Match (2020 - 2022)
- Identified teams that won more duels than their opponent, yet still lost the game — a sign of inefficiency or poor finishing.
- Extended across all three UEFA seasons (2020–2022) for deeper trends.
- Used a `CASE` statement with a multi-season `UNION ALL` and match filtering.

```sql
WITH all_matches AS (
    SELECT '2020' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020
    UNION ALL
    SELECT '2021' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021
    UNION ALL
    SELECT '2022' AS SEASON, * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022
),
...
SELECT
    SEASON,
    STAGE,
    TEAM_LOST
FROM duel_lost_games
WHERE TEAM_LOST IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY SEASON, STAGE;
```

### 3. Top 5 Most Aggressive Teams by Stage
- Identified teams that consistently played aggressively by taking the most total shots during UEFA matches.
- Combined data across 2020–2022 seasons to ensure a broader view of performance.
- Used `RANK()` and `PARTITION BY STAGE` to select the top 5 teams per stage.

```sql
WITH all_matches AS (
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022
),
...
SELECT STAGE, TEAM, TOTAL_SHOTS
FROM ranked_teams
WHERE shot_rank <= 5;
```

### 4. Most Efficient Teams (Shots on Target per Shot Attempt)
- Calculated which teams were most efficient in turning shot attempts into shots on target across all UEFA seasons (2020–2022).
- Combined home and away stats using `UNION ALL`, then aggregated and ranked based on an efficiency ratio.
- Used `ROUND()` and `NULLIF()` for clean, safe calculation of ratios.

```sql
WITH all_matches AS (
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022
),
...
SELECT
    TEAM,
    TOTAL_TARGETS,
    TOTAL_SHOTS,
    ROUND(TOTAL_TARGETS / NULLIF(TOTAL_SHOTS, 0), 3) AS EFFICIENCY
FROM team_total_shots
ORDER BY EFFICIENCY DESC;
```

### 5. Win Probability Accuracy Tracker
- Compares predicted outcomes with actual results.
- Evaluates prediction model reliability.

### 6. Possession vs. Result Correlation
- Investigates the myth: “More possession = more wins.”
- Shows whether tactical dominance leads to real results.
