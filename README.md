# ⚽ Producing Soccer Insights for a Sports Media Agency

This SQL project analyzes match data from the UEFA Championship (2020–2022) to uncover team performance patterns and tactical insights. The goal is to generate actionable insights for a sports media agency using Snowflake SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Identify team performance trends based on possession, duels, and shots.
- Evaluate predictive model accuracy based on actual match outcomes.
- Develop reusable SQL views to optimize analytical workflows.
- Visualize data to support data storytelling for media/reporting use cases.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- **SQL** (Snowflake dialect)
- **Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse**
- (Optional) Python + Jupyter Notebooks for visualization

---

## 📊 Datasets

- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2020`
- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2021`
- `SOCCER.TBL_UEFA_2022`

Each table contains match-level statistics, team names, scores, possession metrics, and prediction probabilities for each UEFA match played.

## 🧠 Core Analyses

### 1. 🏆 Team With Most Games of Majority Possession
- **Query**: Identifies which team dominated possession most frequently from 2020–2022.
- **Skills**: CASE statements, UNION ALL, aggregation, ranking.

### 2. 🥊 Duel Winners Who Still Lost the Match (2022)
- **Query**: Lists teams that won more duels but still lost — broken down by match stage.
- **Skills**: Conditional CASE logic, filtering, tactical analysis.

## 🚀 Extended Insights

### 3. 📈 Top 5 Most Aggressive Teams by Stage
- Calculated total shots taken by teams across all stages.
- Reveals high-pressure play styles.

### 4. 🎯 Most Efficient Teams (Shots on Target per Goal)
- Measures finishing quality.
- Highlights teams that convert chances effectively.

### 5. 🎲 Win Probability Accuracy Tracker
- Compares predicted outcomes with actual results.
- Evaluates prediction model reliability.

### 6. ⚖️ Possession vs. Result Correlation
- Investigates the myth: “More possession = more wins.”
- Shows whether tactical dominance leads to real results.

## 📦 Views Created
